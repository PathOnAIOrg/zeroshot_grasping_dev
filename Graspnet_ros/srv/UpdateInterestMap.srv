# UpdateInterestMap.srv
#
# Service used by the NBV pipeline to update the internal interest
# (saliency) map with a list of candidate grasps produced by GraspNet
# together with their grasp quality scores.
#
# Request -------------------------------------------------------------
#  geometry_msgs/Pose[] grasps   : 6-DOF candidate grasp poses in the
#                                  map frame ordered by descending
#                                  quality.
#  float32[] scores              : Quality/confidence score associated
#                                  with each pose (same length as
#                                  `grasps`).
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Response ------------------------------------------------------------
#  bool success                  : True if the map was updated
#                                  successfully, False otherwise.
